<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hello! I'm Alif Syahmi, a web developer based in Malaysia. 
  I'm also a student pursuing my degree in Computer Science. 
  My current background aligns well with my greatest passion. While I'm not specifically focused on building websites, I have a deep passion for anything related to computers and technology. 
  With that much passion, I'm here to bring your ideas into life and make your online presence shine.

  Becoming a developer is a dream come true. Being able to work while surveying flight tickets is an amazing idea. 
  I'm hinting on the opportunity to work remotely, from any corner of the world. Isn't that impressive? 
  I can proudly say that my career is hands down the best career I could ever imagine.

  Apart from fantasizing about my travelling journey while working. 
  I would never abandon my work. It's my responsibilty to serve the best output to my clients.
